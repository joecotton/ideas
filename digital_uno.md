# Digital Uno

* Multiple units, cooperating over ESP-NOW, LoRa, WiFi, or BLE
* Each unit has a battery, LCD display, and buttons. Maybe a beeper/speaker
* Need one unit for each player, plus one for the draw/discard deck
* Each unit can be identical, first one to be turned on is the main deck.
* Units self-arrange in the order they are powered on.
* Users can see their hand -- scrolling if necessary
* Main deck unit keeps track of user turns, and turn-affecting cards like reverse and skip
